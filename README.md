# Bacularis - The Bacula web interface

Bacularis is a web interface to configure, manage and monitor Bacula backup environment. It is a complete solution for setting up backup jobs, doing restore data, managing tape or disk volumes in local and remote storage, work with backup clients, and doing daily administrative work with backups. It also supports autochanger management. Bacularis provides advanced user management and role-based access control that enable to configure it for regular users where every user can log in to the web interface and does backup and restore own computer data only.

The project consists of two web applications: the web interface and Bacula programming interface (API) with separate administrative panel. The web interface can work with multiple Bacularis API instances to configure and manage remote Bacula components.

Bacularis is a friendly fork of Baculum. It has been founded by Baculum's creator to simplify Baculum features that they could be used not only by users with strong Bacula skills but also by beginners or intermediate users.
